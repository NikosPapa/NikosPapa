## Hi there 👋

I'm Nick, a mathematician and data enthusiast from Greece. I studied Statistics and Actuarial Financial Mathematics at the University of the Aegean and earned a Master's in Mathematics with a focus on Science, Business, and Policy from the University of Groningen.

I love combining math, statistics, and programming to make sense of data. With hands-on experience in R, Excel, SQL, and Tableau, I enjoy turning numbers into actionable insights, solving real-world problems, and helping teams make smarter decisions.

This is a fresh profile where I share projects, analyses, and insights I’ve created, as well as those I plan to develop in the future.
